# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker: East African Region Analysis

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 trends across East African countries, utilizing real-world epidemiological data to understand the pandemic's impact, vaccination progress, and regional patterns. The analysis focuses on eight East African countries: Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Somalia.

## Project Objectives

1. **Epidemiological Analysis**

   - Track and analyze COVID-19 case progression across East African countries
   - Examine mortality rates and patterns
   - Identify regional trends and anomalies in disease spread

2. **Vaccination Impact Assessment**

   - Evaluate vaccination rollout effectiveness
   - Analyze vaccination coverage rates
   - Assess correlation between vaccination and case/death rates

3. **Healthcare System Response**

   - Analyze healthcare system capacity and response
   - Evaluate testing and reporting practices
   - Identify areas for healthcare system improvement

4. **Data-Driven Insights**
   - Generate actionable insights for public health policy
   - Identify best practices in pandemic response
   - Provide recommendations for future health crisis management

## Technical Implementation

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13.2 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/Mochez01/Covid-19_Tracker.git
   cd Covid-19_Tracker
   ```



. Open `covid-19_tracker.ipynb`

## Key Findings and Insights

### 1. Case Distribution Patterns

- Kenya and Uganda reported the highest case burdens, suggesting either higher transmission rates or more robust testing systems
- Multiple distinct waves of infection were observed across the region
- Significant variation in testing and reporting practices between countries

### 2. Mortality Analysis

- Death rates varied significantly across countries
- Healthcare system capacity emerged as a critical factor in mortality rates
- Some countries demonstrated more effective case management despite similar case loads

### 3. Vaccination Progress

- Overall vaccination coverage remained below optimal levels
- Significant disparities in vaccination rates between countries
- Correlation observed between vaccination rates and subsequent case reduction

### 4. Regional Patterns

- Asynchronous timing of COVID-19 waves across countries
- Varying effectiveness of containment measures
- Diverse healthcare system responses and capabilities

## Recommendations

### Short-term Actions

1. Strengthen regional cooperation in pandemic response
2. Improve vaccination distribution and uptake
3. Enhance healthcare system capacity

### Long-term Strategies

1. Develop robust data collection and reporting systems
2. Implement targeted interventions based on country-specific patterns
3. Establish regional health crisis management protocols

## Future Work

- Expand analysis to include economic impact
- Incorporate additional health indicators
- Develop predictive models for future outbreaks
- Create interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring
